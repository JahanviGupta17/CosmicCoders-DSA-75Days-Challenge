## Q10: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

:: Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        k = 1

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1

        return k
:: Approach

Use a pointer k to keep track of the position for the next unique element.
Iterate through the array, and whenever a new unique element is found, place it at position k.
Increment k for each unique element encountered.
:: Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.
