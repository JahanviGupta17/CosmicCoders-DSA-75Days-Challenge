## Q6: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

:: Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        total_profit = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
                total_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]

        return total_profit
:: Approach

Iterate through the array and, whenever there is a price increase, add the profit to the total.
:: Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.
